# MTG-based-Story-Game
This is my first fictional story-based Game inspired by the MTG - Streets Of New Capenna Card Game (by Wizards of the Coast).
The storyline will change according to your choices in the game.
I initially coded it with Python but I wanted to make a nice interface for it and that is the reason that I converted it to HTML - CSS - JS.\
I hope you like it!\
